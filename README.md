# kodi plugin.program.launcher
Launch other programs on my personal Kodi setup. Matrix/Python3 compliant!

I am sure I am violating all sorts of best practicies and style guidelines here. The reason this plugin exists is twofold. First, Advanced Launcher doesn't work on Kodi 19 Matrix due to it not being written with Python3. The second is that this is really just to familiarize myself with the addon/plugin structure in Kodi. I have no idea how settings or user data work so I'm doing some really stupid things in here. Use at your own peril.
